AB  - Abstract PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a public chemical database that serves scientific communities as well as the general public. This database collects chemical information from hundreds of data sources and organizes them into multiple data collections, including Substance, Compound, BioAssay, Protein, Gene, Pathway, and Patent. These collections are interlinked with each other, allowing users to discover related records in the various collections (e.g., drugs targeting a protein or genes modulated by a chemical). PubChem can be searched by keyword (e.g., a chemical, protein, or gene name) as well as by chemical structure. The input structure can be provided using popular line notations or drawn with the PubChem Sketcher. PubChem supports various types of structure searches, including identity search, 2-D and 3-D similarity searches, and substructure and superstructure searches. Results from multiple searches can be combined using Boolean operators (i.e., AND, OR, and NOT) to formulate complex queries. PubChem allows the user to quickly retrieve a list of records annotated with a particular classification or ontological term. This paper provides step-by-step instructions on how to explore PubChem data with examples of commonly requested tasks. ? 2021.

AB  - Abstract The Protein Ensemble Database (PED; https://proteinensemble.org/) is the major repository of conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Conformational ensembles of IDPs are primarily provided by their authors or occasionally collected from literature, and are subsequently deposited in PED along with the corresponding structured, manually curated metadata. The modeling of conformational ensembles usually relies on experimental data from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), NMR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, or a combination of these techniques. The growing number of scientific studies based on these data, along with the astounding and swift progress in the field of protein intrinsic disorder, has required a significant update and upgrade of PED, first published in 2014. To this end, the database was entirely renewed in 2020 and now has a dedicated team of biocurators providing manually curated descriptions of the methods and conditions applied to generate the conformational ensembles and for checking consistency of the data. Here, we present a detailed description on how to explore PED with its protein pages and experimental pages, and how to interpret entries of conformational ensembles. We describe how to efficiently search conformational ensembles deposited in PED by means of its web interface and API. We demonstrate how to make sense of the PED protein page and its associated experimental entry pages with reference to the yeast Sic1 use case. ? 2021 The Authors.
